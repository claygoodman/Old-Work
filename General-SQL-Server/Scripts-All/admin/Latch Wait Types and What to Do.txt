acceptable wait types
---------------------------
lazwriter_sleep
sqltrace_buffer_flush
logmgr_queue
checkpoint_queue
request_for_deadlock_search

************************
CXPACKET waits
--------------------------
long waits mean maxdop query hint or another wait
another wait may be causing it

*****************************
Latch Definitions
--------------------------------
ACCESS_METHODS_DATASET_PARENT / ACCESS_METHODS_SCAN_RANGE_GENERATOR

	appear with CXPACKET and PAGEIOLATCH_XX waits
		maybe increase cost of parallelism, maxdop hint, RG to limit DoP
		maybe exec plan change from seeks to scans, frag'ed statistics

ACCESS_METHODS_HOBT_COUNT 
	flushes p & r cnt difs from HoBt to metadata tables; large #s mean hits on one table

LOG_MANAGER 
	a t-log is growing because it could not clear
		SELECT log_reuse_wait_desc FROM sys.databases WHERE name = 'dbname'

TRACE_CONTROLLER 
	if lots, too many traces running

DBCC_MULTIOBJECT_SCANNER 
	KB 2634571

ACCESS_METHODS_HOBT_VIRTUAL_ROOT 
	reads index metadata looking for a root pageID; page splits force latch into EX mode; forces threads using SH to wait.
	may come from large concurrent connections on a small index without page splits

FGCB_ADD_REMOVE 
	= File Group Control Block
	caused by auto grow, create or concurrent allocations in a filegroup with lots of files


DATABASE_MIRRORING_CONNECTION 
	too many database mirroring sessions on the server


NESTING_TRANSACTION_FULL / NESTING_TRANSACTION_READONLY
	controls access to parallel nested transactions
	_FULL = active trans
	suggests unwanted parallelism


SOS_SCHEDULER_YIELD
	high count/low wait = good
	high count/high wait = contending queries
	low count/high wait = someone not yielding or preemptive threads hogging CPU


discover wait types 
select map_value from sys.dm_xe_map_values 


DBMIRROR_DBM_EVENT
	log shipping to secondary delay

LOG_REUSE_WAIT in sys.databases
	prevents truncating log

session status of PRECONNECT
	a logon trigger or RG classifier function stalled a login

"LOADER LOCK WAIT" in sys.dm_os+spinlock+stats
	"backoffs" in poorly written DLL
